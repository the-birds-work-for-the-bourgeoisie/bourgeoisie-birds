# Overview

Bourgeoise Birds is an educational computer game created in Python Arcade. The user plays a robot disguised as a bird conducting surveillance on behalf of the infamous "Bourgeoisie." As the player navigates their way through the city, they will be confronted with math problems that they need to solve. A building with three windows will be shown to the player through which they can fly through, each with a possible answer to the math problem. Only the window with the correct answer will allow the player to continue on to the next problem.

To start the software, the user needs to run `main.py`. A screen will pull up with three level options, along with an option to look at high scores. Once the user chooses a level, the game will begin. The bird is controlled with just two keys: `W` makes the bird fly up, and `S` makes the bird dive down. A score will be displayed on the screen, and will increase with each successfully answered question. The game ends when the user provides an incorrect answer. If the user achieves a new high score, they will be able to provide their initials, and the new high score will be stored along with the other high scores. The user will then be returned to the first screen, and may replay.
